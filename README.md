# NEW YORK TIMES CLONE

> We built a clone of [this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0) using pure HTML and CSS. On the CSS side, we did the entire layout using CSS positioning and floats. No Grid or Flexbox was used.
